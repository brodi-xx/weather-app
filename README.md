# Weather App
In this project, the user can search a city and get the weather pulled for said city. When searching, the last city searched will remain on the page. The app can be found <a href = "https://brodi-xx.github.io/weather-app/">here</a>.
<ul>When a city is searched, the user will be given the current temp, humidity, and wind.</ul>
<ul>The weather app will save a user's most recently searched city after closing</ul>
<ul>This is a simple weather table that can viewed on most screens even as small as an iPhone 12</ul>
<ul>I ulitized TAs, youtube, a friend who is a professional developer, and W3 to help me complete this.
